# **Nilnovi Extension README**

This extension allows you to write, compile and execute programs in Nilnovi.

## **Features**

This extension provides :

- **IntelliSense**
- Tracking of **Compilation** and **Execution** errors
- **Dynamic display** of the pile

## **Quick start**

* First, open a file with the ```.nn``` extension to activate all the features of this extension
* Then, write your program with all those wonderful tools
* With that done, you can run your program by tapping ```F1``` (by default) to open the VSCode commands list and use ```run Nilnovi```
* This will generate a new file called ```yourFileName.machine_code``` and open a new tab where you will see the machine_code and the pile.
